                                    scientist Dr. Isaac Goiz Durán. It involves the use of kinesthetic testing to detect

                                    in the body’s pH, and the application of magnets for therapeutic benefit and to

                                    to homeostasis. Medical biomagnetism is a non-invasive, painless therapy, which
                                    improves
                                    recovery time without the side effects associated with conventional medicine.</h2>

                                                and a magnet is used to identify areas of pH imbalance. Your
                                                therapist will then apply magnets to the affected areas for 15 to 20
                                                minutes.

                                                3 sessions are recommended as minimum. Chronic or degenerative
                                                conditions may require multiple sessions. The frequency of sessions

                                    <h2>In the seminar which Dr Goiz attended, Dr. Broeringmeyer taught that organs and
                                        tissues in the body can become magnetically polarized, negatively or positively,
                                        and
                                        explained his technique to locate magnetic polarizations using applied
                                        kinesiology.
                                        Applied kinesiology is an alternative medicine method of diagnosis and treatment
                                        based on muscle strength testing. Its premise is that muscles have specific
                                        relationships with organs and glands and therefore weakness in a specific muscle
                                        is
                                        an indicator of a problem in the associated organ or gland. Proponents of
                                        applied
                                        kinesiology contend that healing that muscle weakness will also heal the problem
                                        in
                                        the associated organ or gland. Dr. Broeringmeyer found polarizations in the body
                                        by
                                        looking for changes in muscle strength. He then applied a magnet to the
                                        polarized
                                        area, to cause depolarization, thus returning the area to it's correct healthy
                                        magnetic charge.</h2>

                                                'emotional' points where the area is said to have polarised due to
                                                emotional energy. Dr Goiz does not focus too much on why the area became
                                                polarised, knowing that since the affected areas can be located and
                                                corrected there is no need for further investigation.

                                                the pathogen can only be present in an area that is predisposed or
                                                already polarised, so the question is, what changes the pH before the

                                                weaken different areas of the body, depending on the nature of the
                                                conflict or emotion. Biomagnetic pair therapy would help to return the
                                                tissue back to a healthy pH, releasing the stuck emotional energy. There
                                                are even suggestions that certain pathogens resonate with certain
                                                emotions. This seems especially true in the case of Lyme disease, where

                                    <h4>The therapy technique Biodecoding, or Bioneuroemotion, works on the theory that
                                        physical symptoms are often an expression of a suppressed or unconscious
                                        emotion.

                                        An unresolved traumatic event can cause trapped emotions, which contain energy,
                                        and
                                        a deep-rooted belief about yourself or the world, and a set of thoughts which
                                        maintain the belief and the emotion.

                                        Over time, the energy held by the emotion inside your body affects your physical
                                        health, creating symptoms that can be decoded.

                                        Also, the long-term repetition of such thoughts affects your perception of the
                                        world, seeing only evidence to support your belief.

                                        Changing a belief starts with releasing the emotion connected to the trauma.

                                        A physical symptom that has arisen, can in turn influence your feelings and
                                        emotions, which perpetuates the whole thing, and there are even theories about
                                        pathogens resonating with certain emotions.

                                        This further shows the need for a multi-layered approach to healing to find the
                                        root, release the emotion, retrain the thoughts and break the cycle.

                                        Toxic emotions are just as harmful as toxic food, toxic thoughts or toxic
                                        pathogens.

                                        New studies in Epigenetics are also showing how emotional trauma can be passed
                                        down
                                        genetically, so what you are processing now, may not even be your own. Our
                                        generation may have inherited traumas which our grandparents or ancestors were
                                        not
                                        in a position to overcome.

                                        The theory of emotional energy causing physical symptoms has it's foundations in
                                        Dr
                                        Hamer's 'German New Medicine' and these ideas were later developed into
                                        therapeutic
                                        techniques by Enric Corbera (Bioneuroemotion) and Christian Fleche
                                        (Biodecoding).

                                    <h4>Naturopathy is the use of various natural treatments and therapies to support
                                        the
                                        body in healing itself.

                                        Any illness is a two sided coin. A disease can only affect a body or organ that
                                        is
                                        somehow weakened, whether physically, or energetically.

                                        The body is the environment, that allows for the disease. Like a cake mould and
                                        the
                                        cake. Specific conditions in the environment allow for specific diseases to
                                        arise.

                                        Therefore healing is also a two sided coin, using treatments and techniques to
                                        heal
                                        the environment, and on the other hand, tackle the pathogens causing the
                                        disease.
                                        Naturopathy puts the emphasis on the former, reducing the need for the latter.

                                        It involves a holistic view of all the symptoms a person has, whether physical
                                        or
                                        psycho-emotional, and suggesting natural treatments to improve their all-round
                                        health and well-being.

                                        This may include advice on herbal medicine, supplements, external environmental
                                        factors, diet, lifestyle changes, massage, reflexology points, acupressure
                                        points,
                                        homeopathy, emotional release, examining core beliefs and thought patterns,
                                        exercise, breathing techniques, aromatherapy and so on.

                                        Though many of these factors may not be the cause of the current illness, they
                                        all
                                        contribute to how the body is going to heal.

                                        Herbal medicine and aromatherapy can work on both physical factors and emotional
                                        ones at the same time, and also affect your thoughts. Eg. One essential oil can
                                        be
                                        antiviral and anti-inflammatory, while also being calming, relaxing your nervous
                                        system and your body, interrupting a panic attack or a negative thought cycle.

                                        In Central America the metaphysical side of plant medicine is also taken into
                                        consideration, not just the chemical components. This multi-layered effect is
                                        possibly what makes herbal medicine work better for some people than modern
                                        'allopathic' medicine, however modern medicine definitely has its place too.

                                        Naturopathy not only looks at alternative medicine, but also how the client has
                                        become unwell, and therefore the steps involved in allowing healing to now take
                                        place. Generally a little advice will be combined with the magnet therapy or
                                        focused
                                        on in a separate session for a more complete consultation.</h4>

                                    <h3>Eastern Body Massage

                                        Therapeutic massage has been used for thousands of years and is known to benefit
                                        physical, mental, and emotional health, alleviating stress, releasing muscle
                                        tension
                                        and energetic blockages.

                                        Eastern Body Massage uses a wide range of massaging techniques, anatomy
                                        knowledge
                                        and intuition to provide the maximum holistic health benefits.

                                        Massage can increase our overall energy levels and mental performance both
                                        through
                                        disintoxication and nerve stimulation. It is therefore beneficial not only for
                                        stress relief, or muscle pain, but to aid healing from many illnesses.

                                        It encourages the body to heal itself and has been shown to reduce anxiety and
                                        behavioural problems, increase immunity to illness, promote mental well-being,
                                        alleviate depression, improve our ability to relate to others, and also
                                        generates
                                        oxytocin, giving feelings of love.

                                        Whether you suffer from work-related stress, chronic illness or just want to
                                        treat
                                        yourself, a massage is like taking a small holiday.

                                        Treatment time can be 45 mins, 1hr or 1.5hr.</h3>
